# Web-Design-Challenge
In this project, I had to build a visualisation dashboard website based on visualisations created in a previous project on weather data. In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which the user can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualisations and their corresponding explanations. There is also have a landing page, a page where the user can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where the user can view the data used to build them.
